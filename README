a) WHAT IS CombTEs:
CombTEs, a Perl script for Unix-like systems, is an auxiliary tool aimed to combine results from other programs, methods, and pipelines used to search for Transposable Elements (TEs) (and NOT to directly identify/classify TEs in a genome sequence).

Potentially, CombTEs would be able to deal with results from any tool (see "FLEXIBILITY OF CombTEs" below) aimed at identification and classification of TEs, running on sequences of any genome, and considering any TE classification level (class, subclass, order, superfamily, family, and subfamily - Wicker et al., 2007).
{ Wicker at al., 2007. A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements. Nat. Rev. Genet. 8, 973-982. }

Based on this, the RepeatMasker (RM), HMMER, and RPS-Blast programs were used here SIMPLY to test the functionalities of CombTEs and evaluate the correctness of the generated combined results, searching for TEs of the LTR-retrotransposon (LTR-RT) order. These tools were chosen because they are commonly used and consider very different approaches for TE identification.

If you do not want to use any of those programs, SYMPLY change the "@tools" parameter in the "ParamsGeneral.pm" file (see instructions there).

About the library for RM and the pHMMs for HMMER, one can use customized or public ones (for example, pHMMs from Dfam). Here, three different types of pHMMs (three for each LTR-RT superfamily: Bel-PAO, Copia, and Gypsy) are made available (see "ABOUT THE AVAILABLE pHMMs" below) - all this (programs, libraries, pHMMs, etc.) has no influence on the behaviour of CombTEs, since its actions do not depend on the chosen material. 

The output files of CombTEs present each resulting combination as "GROUP", describing the classification of that GROUP and several other details (see "THE OUTPUT FILES" below).

CombTEs allows to work on a whole chromosome or a set of small genome sequences.

CombTEs is quite simple to use, requiring no software installation and no computer programming knowledge to use it – just run the available scripts on the results from the tools used to search for TEs. Even for the ones with no experience in programming, it is quite simple and ease to change its parameters (see "CHANGING PARAMETERS" below).

CombTEs was written in a simple and direct way (in terms of programming). Thus, for the ones with knowledge in computer programming, it is possible to include results from other tools in a very simply manner.


b) HOW TO USE IT:
The idea is that the tools/systems used to search for TEs would be run just ONCE (normally, for hours) and, after that, the user can perform very fast and easily many combination processes using CombTEs considering the **same** initial results from those tools, each combination using different values for the parameters used by CombTEs and its associated parsing scripts (each combination is run in few seconds).
The user can, then, compare the answers of these tests to obtain the final conclusions/results about the TE candidates identified by those tools in a query sequence.


c) FLEXIBILITY OF CombTEs:
To parse (to extract and format) the initial predictions, for the ones using RM, HMMER, and/or RPS-Blast, the "extractHmmerRM.pl" and "extractRPSB.pl" scripts are made available here.
WARNING: "extractHmmerRM.pl" and "extractRPSB.pl" work fine parsing results from "version open-4.0.5" of RM, "version 3.1b1" of HMMER ("nhmmer" program, using "--tblout" option), and "version 2.10.1+" of RPS-Blast (or other versions which maintain the format of the output file).

When using a different tool, the related script must be implemented (in Perl or other language) to write the initial results in the format accepted by CombTEs.

After preprocessing the initial results from those programs, CombTEs can be run and, during execution, it launches its associated scripts to generate the TE candidates for each used tool.

Considering the performed tests, the "finalCandidsHmmerRM.pl" and "finalCandidsRpsBlast.pl" scripts are made available here.

HOW THEY WORK:
"finalCandidsHmmerRM.pl" can deal with results from RM and HMMER in an independent way; this means that, besides accepting the use of HMMER and RM together (at the same search process), CombTEs also allows to use only one of them with other tools in the searches for TEs (for this, just change the "@tools" array in "ParamsGeneral.pm" file);
Initially, for each tool, "finalCandidsHmmerRM.pl" generates the candidates of each TE type of interest (one file for each TE type) -the generic term “TE type” is used in this work to specify the TE classification level of interest in an analysis. Thus, the user can verify the final candidates of each tool; in this step, the predictions for each TE type are filtered based on the used metrics (i.e., E-value and SW score, reported by HMMER and RM). After that, "finalCandidsHmmerRM.pl" compares the initial candidates of all TE type from EACH tool that are inside a specific region of the query sequence and selects the best identified candidate (i.e., the one with the lowest E-value OR the highest SW score) as the **final candidate for that tool** – only one file, with the selected candidates (with all TE types together), is generated for each tool.

An equivalent script ("finalCandidsRpsBlast.pl") can be used to generate the final candidates of RPS-Blast with the TE classification based on the conserved domains (Wicker et al., 2007) identified into a delimited region of the query sequence (in the case of superfamilies, if only "integrase" is identified in this region, the final candidate is classified as "inconclusive" because the sequence could be a Bel-PAO, Copia, or Gypsy TE (Wicker et al., 2007)); the script filters the predictions based on their E-values – only one final file is produced by this script for all TE types together.

USING ANOTHER PROGRAM:
When using another tool with CombTEs, the user has to provide the necessary script (in Perl or other language) to process its results. This new script has to generate a file with all final candidates of that tool, for all considered TE types together, in the following format:
CANDIDATE_1 - FROM: pos_INIT - TO: pos_FINAL - LENGTH: length - SENSE: Direct/Reverse - CLASSIFICATION: TEtype_A
PREDIC---FROM--pos_from---TO--anyPos---LENGTH--length_1---METRICS--metr---SENSE--D/R---TETYPE--TEtype_A
PREDIC---FROM--anyPos---TO--anyPos---LENGTH--length_2---METRICS--metr---SENSE--D/R---TETYPE--TEtype_A
...
PREDIC---FROM--anyPos---TO--anyPos---LENGTH--length_N---METRICS--metr---SENSE--D/R---TETYPE--TEtype_A
(one blank line) (PAY ATTENTION HERE)*********
CANDIDATE_2 - FROM: pos_INIT - TO: pos_FINAL - LENGTH: length - SENSE: Direct/Reverse - CLASSIFICATION: TEtype_B
PREDIC---FROM--pos_from---TO--anyPos---LENGTH--length_1---METRICS--metr---SENSE--D/R---TETYPE--TEtype_B
...
...

"CANDIDATE_1", "CANDIDATE_2", etc. must be sorted by their "FROM: " positions ("pos_INIT") inside each query sequence; the value of "METRICS" ("metr") will be used when filtering the predictions before producing the final candidates of each used tool.

The predictions ("PREDIC") that make up each "CANDIDATE" must be sorted using their "FROM--" positions; then, the "FROM--" position ("pos_from") of the first prediction (i.e., the lowest value among the "FROM--" positions of all "PREDIC") of a same CANDIDATE will be the "FROM: " position ("pos_INIT") of that CANDIDATE. For the "TO: " position ("pos_FINAL") of a CANDIDATE, select the highest value among the "TO--" position ("anyPos") of all "PREDIC".

WARNING: two things must be done for CombTEs works fine with a new tool:
i) change the following parameters in the "ParamsGeneral.pm" file: "@tools", "%filterTools", and "%goodMetrTools" (see explanation in "ParamsGeneral.pm");
ii) include a new "test condition" in "CombTEs.pl" - search for "OBS_A" and "OBS_B" in the "CombTEs.pl" script.


d) THE USED PARAMETERS:
Several parameters are used by the scripts and can be changed by the user.
The main ones would be used to define the:
- considered TE types;
- used tools;
- threshold/filter values for the tools;
- "good metrics" for the tools - "good metrics" for a tool defines the value/threshold of the tool's metrics for which the user might consider a prediction as a correct one (but yet demanding curation);
- maximum distance from a candidate to the next one to consider them inside a SAME final GROUP;
- minimum length for a tool's prediction to be included in the analyses.


e) THE OUTPUT FILES:
CombTEs produces files in 2 formats: text and CSV that are readable by both humans (making easier the curation step) and automated systems (for additional automated analyses).

The final file produced by CombTEs (called “FinalClassification.txt”) describes all "GROUPs" generated in the combination process, with details about each candidate (from each tool) that forms the group.
Example of information about a formed GROUP:
GROUP 44 - FROM: 192743 - TO: 195971 - LENGTH: 3229 - SENSE: Reverse - CLASS: Gypsy - TOOL(S): HMMER/RepeatMasker/RpsBlast
    CANDIDATE_74 - FROM: 192743 - TO: 195971 - LENGTH: 3229 - SENSE: Reverse - CLASSIFICATION: Gypsy		HMMER
	PREDIC---FROM--192743---TO--195971---LENGTH--3229---EVALUE--3.4e-153---SCORE--499.1---SENSE--Reverse---TETYPE--Gypsy
    CANDIDATE_72 - FROM: 193015 - TO: 195690 - LENGTH: 2676 - SENSE: Reverse - CLASSIFICATION: Gypsy		RpsBlast
	DOMAIN--rve---FROM--193015---TO--193323---LENGTH--309---EVALUE--3.93e-11---SCORE--61.2---SENSE--Reverse
	DOMAIN--RNase_HI_RT_Ty3---FROM--193912---TO--194253---LENGTH--342---EVALUE--2.51e-42---SCORE--150---SENSE--Reverse
	DOMAIN--RT_LTR---FROM--194572---TO--195120---LENGTH--549---EVALUE--4.02e-63---SCORE--212---SENSE--Reverse
	DOMAIN--retropepsin_like---FROM--195448---TO--195690---LENGTH--243---EVALUE--2.46e-06---SCORE--46.9---SENSE--Reverse
    CANDIDATE_120 - FROM: 193895 - TO: 195228 - LENGTH: 1334 - SENSE: Reverse - CLASSIFICATION: Gypsy		RepeatMasker
	PREDIC---FROM--193895---TO--195228---LENGTH--1334---RMSCORE--1067---SENSE--Reverse---MATCHINGREPEAT--YOYOI---TETYPE--Gypsy

This GROUP (44) was produced combining predictions from 3 tools (HMMER, RepeatMasker, and RpsBlast), classified as "Gypsy" in "reverse" sense.
Each GROUP is also written to additional files named “ONE”, “TWO”, “THREE”, etc., depending on the amount of programs where the predictions came from to form that group. 

The CSV file shows a summary of the main information about each formed GROUP (its start and end positions in the query sequence, length, TE type classification, and also the names of the programs used to generate each TE candidate included in the formed group), highlighting (showing) the programs that produced predictions (included in that GROUP) with metrics considered by the user as a good one (the "good metrics" cited above; for example, low E-value and/or high SW score). When RPS-Blast is considered in the analyses, the CVS file can also show the domains identified inside that GROUP.


f) SUMMARIZING:
The user has to:
- run the programs to search for TEs: run them just ONCE (unless the user changes, for example, the tool's database) (normally for hours);
- format the "raw" results produced by these tools (using scripts like "extractHmmerRM.pl" and "extractRPSB.pl");
- run "CombTEs.pl": to combine the TE candidates from the used tools; to do this, CombTEs launches the necessary scripts, like "finalCandidsHmmerRM.pl" and "finalCandidsRpsBlast.pl", that process the results generated by scripts like "extractHmmerRM.pl" and "extractRPSB.pl". 
"CombTEs.pl" runs very fast (also, in the order of seconds).

In a next step, we think in eliminating the usage of scripts like "extractHmmerRM.pl" and "extractRPSB.pl" to consider the direct usage of the raw output of each used program to search for TEs - there are pros and cons in doing this.


The following would be useful for the ones with low experience in running scripts in a Unix-like terminal.

g) RUNNING THE SCRIPTS IN A TERMINAL:
- to extract and format predictions:
	> perl extractHmmerRM.pl TOOL TEtype file-TEtype-tool
		- TOOL = in this case, HMMER or RepeatMasker
		- TEtype = the one of interest
		- file-TEtype-tool = file with initial predictions of TOOL for TEtype
	> perl extractRPSB.pl output_file_rpsblast
		- output_file_rpsblast = in this case, the file from RPS-Blast

- to combine candidates of the used tools:
	> perl CombTEs.pl


h) CHANGING PARAMETERS:
Using a simple text editor, change the necessary parameters directly in the files (or, if you want, "packages") "ParamsGeneral.pm", "ParamsHmmerRM.pm" (when using HMMER and RepeatMasker), and "ParamsRpsblast.pm" (when using RPS-Blast). 
In these files, there are some observations about what to do (and not to do). Please, follow them!

Important: for the ones unfamiliar with Perl language, the "#" symbol means "a comment" that, when in front of a command line, makes that command with no effect.
