REPRODUCING THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN TABLES 1 AND 2 OF THE MAIN TEXT

To reproduce such results, you can either run RepeatMasker, HMMER, and RPS-Blast (option A, below) or simply use results previously obtained (option B).

The "Reproducing_the_tests.zip" file has the complete structure in terms of the needed directories for testing the scripts made available here. Just extract the content of that file.

In each extracted main directory you will find scripts and other sub-directories (with the annotation and empty and non-empty ones for the (new) results to be produced now - the sub-diretories for the used programs have results previously obtained).


A) Reproducing the results running the 3 programs:

TOOLS:
The tests were performed using RepeatMasker (RM), HMMER, and RPS-Blast programs; they were run using their default parameter settings.


GENOME and ANNOTATION:
The used genome and annotation:
- for D. melanogaster: downloaded from FlyBase (flybase.org), version 6.15:
	- ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r6.15_FB2017_02/fasta/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.15.fasta.gz
	- ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r6.15_FB2017_02/fasta/dmel-all-transposon-r6.15.fasta.gz

Here, in this folder, the "Annotation_Dmel.tar.xz" file describe the annotation for D. melanogaster in a format ready to be used in the comparisons with predictions of the used tools.

In the tests, **before running those 3 programs**, the chromosomes were split in subsequences of length of 10,000 nt, with an overlapping region of 1,000 nt, using the "splitOverlap.pl" script also available in this folder.


REFERENCE SEQUENCES:
The reference sequences of LTR-RT were obtained from Repbase (https://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/), version 18.01, used to build the library for RM and to train the pHMMs (the 3 different types of pHMMs for each superfamily - see below). This version provides the necessary information for the tests: the nucleotide (NT) sequences related to the INTERNAL regions of TEs, the start and end positions of their coding sequences (CDS), and the corresponding TE classification. 
The sequences of any Drosophila were excluded from the sets used to build the library for RM and to train the pHMMs to avoid bias, trying to simulate searches for LTR-RT on a newly sequenced genome.

For RM, each reference sequence was labeled with the corresponding superfamily.


ABOUT THE USED pHMMs:
i) the INTERNAL regions of TEs were used to train the pHMMs corresponding to the ways of selecting reference sequences referred to as "conventional way" and "clustering the conventional way" described in the README file, in the main folder of GitHub (please, see there);
ii) the CDS were searched for conserved domains of LTR-RT and the ones presenting at least one region recognized as related to conserved domains of LTR-RT were selected to train the pHMMs - please, see more about this way of selecting reference sequences ("clustering CDS regions") in the README file cited above.

The CD-Hit and MAFFT programs were used to cluster and align the sequences of each formed cluster.

The pHMMs resulting from the trainning process using the reference sequences obtained from Repbase are in the file "pHMMs_Dmel.tar.xz".


ABOUT RUNNING RPS-Blast:
RPS-Blast uses a database to search for conserved domains of protein in a query sequence. The user can download the original PSSM base available at CDD (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd_help.shtml). However, using it, RPS-Blast may take hours to finish.
An alternative: to use the customized database available here ("database_RPSB.tar.xz" file). This database considers only the following conserved domains of LTR-RT (used in the tests):
- Bel-PAO: DUF1758, DUF1759, Peptidase_A17, RT_pepA17;
- Copia: Retrotran_gag, gag_pre-integrs, RVT_2, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1;
- Gypsy: Retrotrans_gag, gag-asp_proteas, retropepsin_like, RP_Saci_like, RVP_2, RT_LTR, RVT_3, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, RNase_HI_like.
And also rve ("integrase"), common for Bel-PAO, Copia, and Gypsy.

How to run RPS-Blast:
you can use:
> ./rpstblastn -query INPUT_FASTA_FILE_NAME -db mydb -outfmt "7 sacc stitle qframe evalue bitscore qstart qend qlen sstart send" -out OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
In this command, "mydb" parameter refers to "mydb.pal" file (available inside the "database_RPSB.tar.xz" file) - for the command above, "mydb.pal" must be in the same directory of "rpstblastn" program.

After running those 3 programs, insert their results (the raw data) inside the corresponding sub-directory (for example, inside "Results_HMMER").
WARNING: the names of the files with these raw data must follow the format of the names of the files inside those sub-directories - see there.


B) Reproducing the results using initial predictions previously obtained:
In this option, since the 3 programs would not be run, the initial predictions related to each program are already inside the corresponding sub-directory (e.g., "Results_HMMER").


C) Running the needed scripts:
The scripts (the original ones) made available in the "Scripts" directory received adaptations to produce the results shown in Tables 1 and 2 of the main text.

Despite the way the raw results from the 3 programs are obtained (either running them again or using the results made available here), the "reproducingTests.pl" script can be run to generate the necessary files - after extracting the complete directory structure from the "Reproducing_the_tests.zip" file, go to a main directory ("Reproducing_the_tests") and run the "reproducingTests.pl" script.

> perl reproducingTests.pl

Then, the following scripts will be launched:
- extractHmmerRM_HMMER.pl
- extractHmmerRM_RM.pl
- extractRPSB.pl
- CombTEs.pl 
- compareGroupsDmel.pl
- compareGroupsDmelGoodMetrics.pl


After that, the results shown in those tables will be in the files of "Table_1" and "Table_2" sub-directories.

I) For Table 1:
- go to the "Table_1" directory;
- the files there show several details, for each chromosome, about the predictions of those 3 programs; for example, the numbers of annotated TEs, the total of combined predictions, and FP and TP;
- at the end of each file, in the "SUMMARY" section, you find the total of combined predictions, and percentages of correct ones, for ALL chromosome together, produced by a set of ONE, any TWO, or all the THREE programs;
- the name of each file corresponds to the used filter for predictions from HMMER, RM, and RPS-Blast, in this sequence - the filter for HMMER and RPS-Blast are always the same. For example:
	- "Summary_comparedGroups-100-225-100.txt" file: using "100" (meaning "No filter") for HMMER/RPS-Blast and "225" (the default value, considered "No filter") for RM;
	- "Summary_comparedGroups-1e-05-400-1e-05.txt" file: filters of "1e-05" for HMMER/RPS-Blast and "400" for RM.

Each line in those files (in the "SUMMARY" section) is self-explanatory.

II) For Table 2:
- in the "Table_2" directory, the 3 files there describe about the total of combined predictions considered (initially) as false positive ones (based on the Dmel annotation) and the ones that have at least one of the used metrics considered as a "good one" (i.e., low E-value and/or high SWscore);
- the word "ONE", "TWO", or "THREE" in the name of each file describes the number of tools considered to produce the combined predictions present in that file.

For example, for the "comparedGroupsGoodMetrics-THREE.txt" file (results from combining candidates produced by ALL the THREE tools), for the first block of information ("Values used as "good" metrics -- HMMER: 1e-10 - RepeatMasker: 410 - RPS-Blast: 1e-10" - these filter values are the ones that appear in the first column of Table 2),
the line:
"TOTAL --- Preds: 1817 -->> FPs: 520 -->> FPs with good metrics: 520 (100%)"
means that, for the used "good metrics", from a total of 1,817 combined predictions, 520 (28.6%) were initially defined as FP ones but 520 (100%) present at least a metrics considered as a good one.
