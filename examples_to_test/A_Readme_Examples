TESTING CombTEs:

The files in this folder can be used as examples to test CombTEs ("CombTEs.pl") and its associated scripts ("finalCandidsHmmerRM.pl" and "finalCandidsRpsBlast.pl") - they are in the "scripts" folder.
These files contain the results from running RepeatMasker, HMMER, and RPS-Blast programs on the "3R chromosome" (with 32.08 Mbp) of D.melanogaster (downloaded from Flybase database), version "r6.15" (i.e., you do not need to run those programs).

Before running those programs, this chromosome was split (using "splitOverlap.pl") in subsequences of length 10,000 nt, with an overlapping region of 1,000 nt.

For RepeatMasker and HMMER, the name of each file is related to the considered superfamily and used tool.
"RPSB.out" is the output file of RPS-Blast.

To test CombTES just:
1) run the "extractHmmerRM.pl" and "extractRPSB.pl" scripts (to parse the cited files, extracting and formating the initial predictions):
	- for RepeatMasker and HMMER:
		> perl extractHmmerRM.pl TOOL SUPERFAM "file_superfam_tool"
		(for example: > perl extractHmmerRM.pl HMMER Copia Copia_HMER.tbl)
	- for RPS-Blast:
		> perl extractRPSB.pl "output_file_rpsblast"
		(for example: perl extractRPSB.pl RPSB.out)

2) run "CombTEs.pl" - it launches "finalCandidsHmmerRM.pl" and "finalCandidsRpsBlast.pl", producing the resulting combined predictions for the 3 programs (the "FinalClassification.txt" and "FinalClassificationTabular.txt" files - "FinalClassificationTabular.txt" can be opened as a spreadsheet).

WARNING: before running "CombTEs.pl", delete the comments ("#") in front of the following FOUR lines in the "ParamsGeneral.pm" file (package):
#@otherTools = ("RpsBlast"); # if "RPS-Blast" is used: delete the comment ("#") in front of this line.
#$outFileNamesOthers{'RpsBlast'} = ("THREE"); # if "RPS-Blast" is used: delete the comment ("#") in front of this line.
#$filterOtherTools{'RpsBlast'} = 1.0e-05; # if "RPS-Blast" is used: delete the comment ("#") in front of this line.
#$goodMetrOtherTools{'RpsBlast'} = 1.0e-20; # if "RPS-Blast" is used: delete the comment ("#") in front of this line.

Several other parameters can be changed in the "ParamsGeneral.pm" package, for example, the filters for the initial predictions from RepeatMasker, HMMER, and RPS-Blast.
