The files in this fold were obtained running RepeatMasker, HMMER, and RPS-Blast on the "3R chromosome" of D.melanogaster (download from Flybase database), version "r6.15".
Before running the programs, this chromosome was split in subsequences of length of 10,000 nt, with an overlapping region of 1,000 nt.
