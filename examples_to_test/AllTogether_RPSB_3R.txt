RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	2.46e-53	192	12499176	12498760	32079331	1	139

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses.

RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	0.13	45.0	2719939	2720049	32079331	1	40

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons.

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	8.20e-50	182	2596848	2597204	32079331	1	120

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	3.10e-39	151	3110743	3111102	32079331	1	120

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	4.47e-20	97.0	3213318	3213563	32079331	39	119

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	1.93e-09	66.6	3254586	3254419	32079331	66	121

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	5.2	38.8	26561388	26561633	32079331	9	92

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	8.19e-05	53.5	17580250	17580606	32079331	2	119

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-3	0.005	48.5	2601953	2601600	32079331	3	128

CDD:133151	cd05484, retropepsin_like_LTR_2, Retropepsins_like_LTR, pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  Retropepsin of retrotransposons with long terminal repeats are pepsin-like aspartate proteases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-1	0.047	44.6	3385852	3385580	32079331	2	90
CDD:133151	cd05484, retropepsin_like_LTR_2, Retropepsins_like_LTR, pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  Retropepsin of retrotransposons with long terminal repeats are pepsin-like aspartate proteases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins.

CDD:285484	pfam08284, RVP_2, Retroviral aspartyl protease.  Single domain aspartyl proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons, and badnaviruses (plant dsDNA viruses). These proteases are generally part of a larger polyprotein; usually pol, more rarely gag. Retroviral proteases appear to be homologous to a single domain of the two-domain eukaryotic aspartyl proteases.	3	0.23	44.0	6177678	6177950	32079331	35	133
