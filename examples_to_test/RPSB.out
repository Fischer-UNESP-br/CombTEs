CDD:133158	cd06094, RP_Saci_like, RP_Saci_like, retropepsin family.  Retropepsin on retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) including Saci-1, -2 and -3 of Schistosoma mansoni. Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.49	31.9	9743	9976	10000	1	78

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	6.63e-45	157	4859	5212	10000	2	120

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	3	1.81e-18	82.4	8424	8762	10000	1	114

CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	0.58	32.7	1827	2090	10000	48	140

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	0.32	33.1	1403	1753	10000	2	127

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	0.32	33.1	2684	3034	10000	2	127

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons.

RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	6.63e-55	186	5243	5596	10000	1	118

While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements.

The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	6.74e-04	40.8	7637	7981	10000	3	125

CDD:133158	cd06094, RP_Saci_like, RP_Saci_like, retropepsin family.  Retropepsin on retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) including Saci-1, -2 and -3 of Schistosoma mansoni. Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	2.3	29.9	95	163	10000	1	23

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	0.022	36.6	3512	3255	10000	27	119

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-1	2.55e-05	45.0	532	185	10000	4	127

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	5.60e-44	155	1621	1932	10000	2	110

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	0.004	37.7	57	191	10000	1	50

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	1.94e-38	139	6431	6769	10000	2	119

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	7.78e-08	52.0	6431	6778	10000	2	120

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	0.007	38.1	6431	6772	10000	3	125

CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	1	1.99e-14	71.0	1870	2214	10000	1	119
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	2.90e-10	58.9	3463	3768	10000	2	110

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	0.013	37.3	2557	2877	10000	17	125

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-2	0.15	33.8	5334	5119	10000	41	114
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	1	0.64	32.1	9844	9969	10000	1	41
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	6.4	29.3	6209	5988	10000	37	117
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-3	9.9	28.8	6101	5988	10000	84	124

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	7.21e-24	97.8	4271	4495	10000	2	77

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	1.26e-07	51.6	8439	8092	10000	1	119

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-2	3.6	30.0	8439	8089	10000	2	127

RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	1.56e-08	53.9	3631	3509	10000	42	81

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-3	9.9	28.8	4742	4629	10000	84	124

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	6.69e-05	43.9	6436	6798	10000	3	128

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements.

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	8.64e-04	40.4	5692	6021	10000	1	113

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-3	0.62	31.5	3872	3663	10000	13	92

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	1.65e-41	148	3839	4186	10000	4	120

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	0.80	31.9	8197	8544	10000	3	127

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	4.31e-39	141	5186	5542	10000	1	119

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers.

RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-1	1.43e-05	45.8	8668	8318	10000	3	127

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	1.04e-05	45.8	5233	5535	10000	10	114

CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	1	1.47e-05	47.5	3493	4050	10000	2	200
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	0.043	35.0	2812	3054	10000	1	88
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	0.36	33.1	4297	4644	10000	3	127

CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	1	3.76e-05	46.3	3448	3780	10000	55	178
CDD:133158	cd06094, RP_Saci_like, RP_Saci_like, retropepsin family.  Retropepsin on retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) including Saci-1, -2 and -3 of Schistosoma mansoni. Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.003	38.0	2408	2686	10000	1	88

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-2	0.80	31.9	7665	7402	10000	44	122

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	4.75e-16	75.5	7391	7194	10000	24	88

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-2	0.003	39.2	3684	3457	10000	49	126

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	0.077	35.0	4144	4257	10000	25	62
CDD:133148	cd05481, retropepsin_like_LTR_1, Retropepsins_like_LTR; pepsin-like aspartate protease from retrotransposons with long terminal repeats.  Retropepsin of retrotransposons with long terminal repeats are pepsin-like aspartate proteases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	0.17	33.2	2772	2963	10000	12	79

The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	0.13	34.3	6889	6990	10000	28	61

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	3	1.95e-06	48.1	4944	5273	10000	20	114

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	5.05e-04	40.4	2097	2303	10000	10	80

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region.

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	0.003	38.5	7923	8177	10000	6	91

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	4.41e-07	50.1	417	629	10000	1	62
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	3	5.80e-05	45.9	5178	5375	10000	99	170

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	0.002	38.8	9412	9666	10000	6	91

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	0.009	36.9	8154	8417	10000	2	91

The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-1	1.42e-04	42.7	6295	6035	10000	6	92
CDD:306564	pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus.

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-2	0.35	32.3	3213	3004	10000	16	90

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	8.76e-05	43.5	1968	1606	10000	1	120
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-2	0.031	35.4	9033	8803	10000	6	92

They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	3	3.25e-04	41.7	1947	2138	10000	6	71
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	3	4.24e-09	55.4	9204	9512	10000	8	114

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	5.23e-08	52.8	8271	8618	10000	1	119
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	3	2.16e-05	47.1	7512	7931	10000	14	172
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	3.28e-05	43.8	6840	7091	10000	1	91
CDD:309014	pfam03732, Retrotrans_gag, Retrotransposon gag protein.  Gag or Capsid-like proteins from LTR retrotransposons. There is a central motif QGXXEXXXXXFXXLXXH that is common to Retroviridae gag-proteins, but is poorly conserved.	1	0.051	34.8	5779	5979	10000	18	86
CDD:133158	cd06094, RP_Saci_like, RP_Saci_like, retropepsin family.  Retropepsin on retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) including Saci-1, -2 and -3 of Schistosoma mansoni. Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	3	3.3	30.4	8271	8621	10000	2	127

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	2.01e-11	62.4	908	1042	10000	1	50

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-2	0.039	35.0	8175	7933	10000	1	88

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements.

CDD:133158	cd06094, RP_Saci_like, RP_Saci_like, retropepsin family.  Retropepsin on retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) including Saci-1, -2 and -3 of Schistosoma mansoni. Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	0.23	32.6	6718	6891	10000	1	57

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	3	0.35	33.1	8037	8381	10000	3	125

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	1.0	31.6	8894	8667	10000	25	117

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.026	35.4	110	352	10000	4	92

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region.

RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	1.32e-06	48.5	1159	1506	10000	1	119

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-1	4.15e-04	40.8	4426	4220	10000	10	80

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-3	0.11	34.6	1826	1455	10000	1	127

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	8.25e-46	160	5775	6134	10000	1	121

RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	0.002	39.3	8493	8305	10000	1	54

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	5.7	29.6	3479	3775	10000	18	127

CDD:133148	cd05481, retropepsin_like_LTR_1, Retropepsins_like_LTR; pepsin-like aspartate protease from retrotransposons with long terminal repeats.  Retropepsin of retrotransposons with long terminal repeats are pepsin-like aspartate proteases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase.

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	5.95e-40	143	6889	7188	10000	2	106

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-3	1.23e-04	43.1	4526	4182	10000	3	125

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	0.12	33.4	1342	1602	10000	8	90

CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	3.86e-05	45.0	6971	7081	10000	1	40

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	3	0.059	35.4	2100	2450	10000	3	125

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	1.34e-47	165	9125	8787	10000	2	119

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-2	0.073	34.2	6933	6679	10000	1	92
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region.

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands.

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	1.20e-50	174	9988	9662	10000	11	119

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-1	2.60e-06	47.7	3880	3530	10000	3	127

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	0.028	36.2	2317	2496	10000	16	70

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	2.98e-52	179	3844	4203	10000	1	119

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.38	32.3	2726	2866	10000	43	90

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-1	1.16e-04	43.1	3205	2861	10000	3	125

CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	1	1.18e-60	205	8458	9006	10000	1	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	6.90e-04	40.0	734	973	10000	6	84

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	1.24e-06	48.9	7154	7504	10000	3	127

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.027	35.4	5717	5959	10000	4	92

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains.

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	2.24e-06	47.8	1659	2015	10000	1	117

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	7.36e-19	84.3	4512	4757	10000	6	87

Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	3	2.17e-10	59.5	2676	3011	10000	1	116
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-2	0.016	36.9	2637	2323	10000	22	127

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	1.29e-46	162	4724	5083	10000	1	120

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	0.001	40.0	9832	9966	10000	1	46

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	1.18e-44	157	2559	2200	10000	1	120

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	3	9.70e-07	49.3	6060	6404	10000	3	127

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	1.58e-14	71.2	2804	2478	10000	1	119

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.37	32.3	1268	1447	10000	8	69

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	0.002	38.8	1798	2043	10000	9	92

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	4.13e-17	78.5	6256	6588	10000	1	112

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	2.02e-06	48.1	5437	5649	10000	1	62
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	1.06e-04	42.3	4045	4302	10000	6	92

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	8.3	28.9	817	611	10000	41	116

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	0.004	38.9	5653	5585	10000	1	23

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-2	0.045	35.8	7203	6892	10000	27	127

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	2.81e-04	41.9	7586	7915	10000	17	128
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-3	4.07e-04	40.8	3818	3579	10000	6	84

CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals.

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	3.52e-16	75.8	1163	1351	10000	51	113

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	3.1	30.4	5246	5596	10000	2	127

While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.71	31.5	794	1024	10000	9	85
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	3.1	30.4	2201	2551	10000	2	127

Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	2.66e-08	52.7	3686	3943	10000	1	92
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	2.69e-07	50.5	5189	5536	10000	1	119
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	2	1.75e-06	50.2	4400	4903	10000	1	186
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	2	1.47e-05	45.4	6152	6466	10000	1	114
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	5.72e-04	41.2	5216	5530	10000	17	124

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	1.35e-10	60.1	2041	2325	10000	10	113

CDD:133158	cd06094, RP_Saci_like, RP_Saci_like, retropepsin family.  Retropepsin on retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) including Saci-1, -2 and -3 of Schistosoma mansoni. Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	1.55e-04	41.9	8121	8252	10000	37	89

RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	1.26e-07	51.6	4541	4888	10000	1	119
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	2	3.64e-07	52.5	3782	4297	10000	14	200
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	2	1.97e-06	47.7	5477	5785	10000	8	114
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.005	37.7	3065	3307	10000	1	88
CDD:309014	pfam03732, Retrotrans_gag, Retrotransposon gag protein.  Gag or Capsid-like proteins from LTR retrotransposons. There is a central motif QGXXEXXXXXFXXLXXH that is common to Retroviridae gag-proteins, but is poorly conserved.	3	0.79	31.3	2028	2180	10000	18	69

While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	3.6	30.0	4541	4891	10000	2	127

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	2.25e-05	45.0	1303	1620	10000	17	124

RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	2	6.21e-09	57.5	3719	4144	10000	17	177
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	1.23e-07	51.6	4505	4849	10000	2	118
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	1.56e-06	48.5	4505	4858	10000	3	128
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	3.37e-05	43.8	3068	3310	10000	4	92

CDD:311594	pfam07727, RVT_2, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses. This Pfam entry includes reverse transcriptases not recognized by the pfam00078 model.	2	3.4	31.5	3680	4219	10000	20	222

RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	1.06e-07	51.6	7792	7439	10000	1	117
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses.

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	3	4.91e-06	46.9	5112	5429	10000	17	124

CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	-3	8.95e-67	222	9215	8688	10000	2	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	1.50e-46	162	8408	8049	10000	1	121

Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	-3	3.45e-29	115	9167	8688	10000	3	189
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-3	4.05e-17	78.5	7589	7257	10000	1	112
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	-3	2.33e-15	73.7	9032	8688	10000	1	119
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	-3	7.41e-09	57.5	9089	8640	10000	45	205
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations.

The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	1.88e-06	48.1	8408	8196	10000	1	62
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-3	1.06e-04	42.3	9800	9543	10000	6	92

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552.

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	5.62e-04	40.4	3205	3456	10000	1	92

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	6.36e-04	41.2	4651	4995	10000	3	125

RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	1	7.50e-59	200	2989	3537	10000	1	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	1	1.48e-27	111	9694	9999	10000	2	103

CDD:147642	pfam05585, DUF1758, Putative peptidase (DUF1758).  This is a family of nematode proteins of unknown function. However, it seems likely that these proteins act as aspartic peptidases.	1	2.68e-11	63.4	8899	9372	10000	1	163
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	5.05e-04	40.4	8935	9141	10000	10	80

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	1.95e-06	48.1	2782	3111	10000	20	114

CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	0.13	34.6	1756	1980	10000	48	132

CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-1	0.25	33.5	9625	9482	10000	65	111

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.003	38.1	5897	6151	10000	1	92

RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus.

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	3.27e-47	164	3244	3597	10000	2	120

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	2.47e-13	67.7	4300	4623	10000	7	114
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	1	2.75e-11	61.8	2617	2961	10000	1	119

CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	1	1.00e-08	57.1	2479	2922	10000	12	178
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	0.002	38.8	1564	1809	10000	9	92

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	1.79e-42	150	9995	9663	10000	10	120

CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	2	2.64e-70	232	7307	7852	10000	1	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	1.37e-55	188	8135	8479	10000	1	120

CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	2	8.60e-13	66.4	7508	7843	10000	1	116

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	2	1.04e-05	45.8	9074	9376	10000	10	114
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	2	1.12e-05	47.9	7334	7891	10000	2	200
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	0.002	38.8	6653	6895	10000	1	88
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	2	0.32	33.1	8135	8485	10000	2	127

CDD:310171	pfam05380, Peptidase_A17, Pao retrotransposon peptidase.  Corresponds to Merops family A17. These proteins are homologous to aspartic proteinases encoded by retroposons and retroviruses.	-3	4.39e-57	194	8066	7602	10000	2	162
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	-3	1.42e-54	189	8756	8115	10000	2	213
CDD:147642	pfam05585, DUF1758, Putative peptidase (DUF1758).  This is a family of nematode proteins of unknown function. However, it seems likely that these proteins act as aspartic peptidases.	-3	2.39e-11	63.4	9551	9078	10000	1	163
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-3	1.95e-06	48.1	6668	6339	10000	20	114
CDD:306564	pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	-3	9.90e-05	44.7	8666	8244	10000	23	168
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-3	5.05e-04	40.4	9515	9309	10000	10	80
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	-3	0.003	38.7	8564	8244	10000	2	99
CDD:316492	pfam13975, gag-asp_proteas, gag-polyprotein putative aspartyl protease.  This family of putative aspartyl proteases is found pre-dominantly in retroviral proteins.	-3	0.007	37.1	9521	9306	10000	8	80
CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	0.13	34.6	7694	7470	10000	48	132
CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	-3	0.42	33.7	8711	8235	10000	22	161

CDD:271180	cd00799, INT_Cre_C, C-terminal catalytic domain of Cre recombinase (also called integrase).  Cre-like recombinases are tyrosine based site specific recombinases. They belong to the superfamily of DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes, which share the same fold in their catalytic domain and the overall reaction mechanism. The bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase maintains the circular phage replicon in a monomeric state by catalyzing a site-specific recombination between two loxP sites. The catalytic core domain of Cre recombinase is linked to a more divergent helical N-terminal domain, which interacts primarily with the DNA major groove proximal to the crossover region.	3	4.4	30.5	1098	1208	10000	67	102

CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	5.95e-57	193	4209	3793	10000	1	139

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:316719	pfam14223, Retrotran_gag_2, gag-polypeptide of LTR copia-type.  This family is found in Plants and fungi, and contains LTR-polyproteins, or retrotransposons of the copia-type.	-3	0.059	35.5	7568	7329	10000	35	121
CDD:309014	pfam03732, Retrotrans_gag, Retrotransposon gag protein.  Gag or Capsid-like proteins from LTR retrotransposons. There is a central motif QGXXEXXXXXFXXLXXH that is common to Retroviridae gag-proteins, but is poorly conserved.	-3	0.072	34.4	7655	7389	10000	2	95
CDD:133158	cd06094, RP_Saci_like, RP_Saci_like, retropepsin family.  Retropepsin on retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) including Saci-1, -2 and -3 of Schistosoma mansoni. Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	3	1.95e-06	48.1	7197	7526	10000	20	114

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	0.13	34.6	6171	6395	10000	48	132

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-2	1.31e-05	45.4	1692	1426	10000	23	114
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-2	0.012	37.3	2664	2350	10000	17	124
CDD:311594	pfam07727, RVT_2, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses. This Pfam entry includes reverse transcriptases not recognized by the pfam00078 model.	-2	0.024	38.0	3477	3088	10000	20	181
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-2	0.23	32.7	4359	4105	10000	1	92

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	1.04e-46	163	3094	2741	10000	2	120

CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	3	1.02e-56	193	7824	8372	10000	1	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	1.76e-45	159	8655	9008	10000	2	120
CDD:306564	pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	3	6.47e-23	97.5	7887	8369	10000	1	188
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	3	7.81e-10	57.9	8028	8372	10000	1	119
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	3	1.78e-08	53.9	9720	9998	10000	7	99
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.

Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	2.51e-08	53.5	8655	9011	10000	2	119
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	3	5.68e-07	51.7	7890	8321	10000	12	174

CDD:310171	pfam05380, Peptidase_A17, Pao retrotransposon peptidase.  Corresponds to Merops family A17. These proteins are homologous to aspartic proteinases encoded by retroposons and retroviruses.	-1	9.73e-45	159	9994	9473	10000	1	161
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-1	2.91e-06	47.3	8506	8189	10000	20	114
CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	3.2	30.4	9571	9308	10000	48	140

CDD:147642	pfam05585, DUF1758, Putative peptidase (DUF1758).  This is a family of nematode proteins of unknown function. However, it seems likely that these proteins act as aspartic peptidases.	-1	4.34e-11	62.6	2581	2117	10000	1	152
CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	-1	0.090	35.7	1642	1163	10000	22	161

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-1	0.53	31.9	2542	2312	10000	10	84
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	-1	2.8	30.2	1495	1166	10000	2	103

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	1	5.94e-12	63.7	9538	9882	10000	1	119
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	2.77e-08	52.3	8764	9012	10000	6	92
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	1	1.22e-04	44.8	9376	9825	10000	1	172
CDD:316492	pfam13975, gag-asp_proteas, gag-polyprotein putative aspartyl protease.  This family of putative aspartyl proteases is found pre-dominantly in retroviral proteins.	1	1.90e-04	41.7	8767	9012	10000	7	91
CDD:309014	pfam03732, Retrotrans_gag, Retrotransposon gag protein.  Gag or Capsid-like proteins from LTR retrotransposons. There is a central motif QGXXEXXXXXFXXLXXH that is common to Retroviridae gag-proteins, but is poorly conserved.	2	0.32	32.5	7820	8020	10000	1	67
CDD:133148	cd05481, retropepsin_like_LTR_1, Retropepsins_like_LTR; pepsin-like aspartate protease from retrotransposons with long terminal repeats.  Retropepsin of retrotransposons with long terminal repeats are pepsin-like aspartate proteases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers.

CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	1	3.74e-68	226	337	882	10000	1	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	3.76e-50	172	1195	1557	10000	1	121

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	1.07e-10	60.0	2179	2511	10000	9	114

This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	5.80e-13	66.6	1504	1827	10000	7	114
CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	1	6.73e-11	62.6	1	156	10000	126	177
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	2.51e-08	53.5	439	795	10000	2	119

CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	1	6.95e-13	66.4	1408	1746	10000	1	117
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	3.23e-09	55.8	3001	3309	10000	2	110
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	1	6.21e-09	57.5	1285	1710	10000	17	177
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	1.23e-07	51.6	2071	2415	10000	2	118
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	1	1.56e-06	48.5	2071	2424	10000	3	128
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	3.37e-05	43.8	634	876	10000	4	92
CDD:316492	pfam13975, gag-asp_proteas, gag-polyprotein putative aspartyl protease.  This family of putative aspartyl proteases is found pre-dominantly in retroviral proteins.	1	0.005	37.5	625	879	10000	1	92

In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-1	1.08e-04	42.3	6196	5954	10000	9	91

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-3	8.89e-13	66.2	9683	9342	10000	1	114

CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	-3	2.01e-60	204	2555	2007	10000	1	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	7.41e-46	160	1724	1371	10000	2	120

CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	-3	2.94e-11	61.8	2351	2007	10000	1	119

Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements.

CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	-3	1.48e-06	50.6	2489	2058	10000	12	174
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase.

CDD:310171	pfam05380, Peptidase_A17, Pao retrotransposon peptidase.  Corresponds to Merops family A17. These proteins are homologous to aspartic proteinases encoded by retroposons and retroviruses.	-3	2.33e-55	189	5333	4869	10000	2	162
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	-3	1.25e-54	189	6023	5382	10000	2	213
CDD:281552	pfam03564, DUF1759, Protein of unknown function (DUF1759).  This is a family of proteins of unknown function. Most of the members are gag-polyproteins.	-3	2.68e-25	103	7661	7218	10000	1	147
CDD:147642	pfam05585, DUF1758, Putative peptidase (DUF1758).  This is a family of nematode proteins of unknown function. However, it seems likely that these proteins act as aspartic peptidases.	-3	2.68e-11	63.4	6818	6345	10000	1	163
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-3	1.95e-06	48.1	3935	3606	10000	20	114
CDD:306564	pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	-3	9.72e-05	44.7	5933	5511	10000	23	168
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-3	5.05e-04	40.4	6782	6576	10000	10	80
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	-3	0.003	38.7	5831	5511	10000	2	99
CDD:316492	pfam13975, gag-asp_proteas, gag-polyprotein putative aspartyl protease.  This family of putative aspartyl proteases is found pre-dominantly in retroviral proteins.	-3	0.007	37.1	6788	6573	10000	8	80
CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	0.13	34.6	4961	4737	10000	48	132
CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	-3	0.41	33.7	5978	5502	10000	22	161

CDD:310171	pfam05380, Peptidase_A17, Pao retrotransposon peptidase.  Corresponds to Merops family A17. These proteins are homologous to aspartic proteinases encoded by retroposons and retroviruses.	1	4.39e-57	194	7771	8235	10000	2	162
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	1	1.25e-54	189	7081	7722	10000	2	213
CDD:281552	pfam03564, DUF1759, Protein of unknown function (DUF1759).  This is a family of proteins of unknown function. Most of the members are gag-polyproteins.	1	2.68e-25	103	5446	5889	10000	1	147
CDD:147642	pfam05585, DUF1758, Putative peptidase (DUF1758).  This is a family of nematode proteins of unknown function. However, it seems likely that these proteins act as aspartic peptidases.	1	3.16e-11	63.0	6289	6762	10000	1	163
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	1	1.95e-06	48.1	9169	9498	10000	20	114
CDD:306564	pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	1	9.02e-05	44.7	7171	7593	10000	23	168
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	5.73e-04	40.4	6325	6531	10000	10	80
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	1	0.003	38.7	7273	7593	10000	2	99
CDD:316492	pfam13975, gag-asp_proteas, gag-polyprotein putative aspartyl protease.  This family of putative aspartyl proteases is found pre-dominantly in retroviral proteins.	1	0.007	37.1	6319	6534	10000	8	80
CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	1	0.13	34.6	8143	8367	10000	48	132

An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	3	2.13e-57	195	8568	9098	10000	2	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	2.23e-37	136	9378	9737	10000	1	121
CDD:306564	pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	3	8.17e-26	105	8616	9098	10000	3	189
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	3	3.57e-11	61.8	8751	9089	10000	1	116
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	5.43e-08	51.6	7974	8243	10000	2	91

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	3	3.44e-17	78.5	1128	1454	10000	1	110

CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	-2	0.003	38.7	9168	8848	10000	2	99
CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	0.13	34.6	8298	8074	10000	48	132

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-2	5.05e-04	40.4	1119	913	10000	10	80

RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	3	0.13	34.6	7455	7679	10000	48	132

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses.

CDD:238825	cd01647, RT_LTR, RT_LTR: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from retrotransposons and retroviruses which have long terminal repeats (LTRs) in their DNA copies but not in their RNA template. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.	-2	6.60e-71	234	5451	4906	10000	1	177
CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	1.35e-57	194	4623	4267	10000	1	120

Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	-2	1.67e-29	116	5403	4906	10000	1	189
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-2	5.11e-15	72.3	3687	3385	10000	8	110
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	-2	8.88e-14	69.1	5250	4915	10000	1	116
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations.

Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	1.06e-07	51.6	4623	4270	10000	1	117

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-2	1.08e-04	42.3	6315	6073	10000	9	91

CDD:285484	pfam08284, RVP_2, Retroviral aspartyl protease.  Single domain aspartyl proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons, and badnaviruses (plant dsDNA viruses). These proteases are generally part of a larger polyprotein; usually pol, more rarely gag. Retroviral proteases appear to be homologous to a single domain of the two-domain eukaryotic aspartyl proteases.	-2	0.73	32.4	6315	6040	10000	32	124

CDD:260006	cd09274, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, Ty3/Gypsy family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-2	1.80e-10	59.7	9999	9886	10000	83	120
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains.

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	1.15e-04	42.3	6817	7089	10000	1	92

In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-1	0.004	38.1	4216	3971	10000	9	92

CDD:147642	pfam05585, DUF1758, Putative peptidase (DUF1758).  This is a family of nematode proteins of unknown function. However, it seems likely that these proteins act as aspartic peptidases.	1	2.68e-11	63.4	4903	5376	10000	1	163
CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	2	1.95e-06	48.1	7784	8113	10000	20	114
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	1	5.05e-04	40.4	4939	5145	10000	10	80
CDD:316492	pfam13975, gag-asp_proteas, gag-polyprotein putative aspartyl protease.  This family of putative aspartyl proteases is found pre-dominantly in retroviral proteins.	1	0.007	37.1	4933	5148	10000	8	80
CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	0.13	34.6	6758	6982	10000	48	132
CDD:239684	cd03714, RT_DIRS1, RT_DIRS1: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) occurring in the DIRS1 group of retransposons. Members of the subfamily include the Dictyostelium DIRS-1, Volvox carteri kangaroo, and Panagrellus redivivus PAT elements. These elements differ from LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	1	0.25	33.3	5890	6093	10000	2	63

CDD:306564	pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	3	2.91e-04	43.2	6987	7409	10000	23	168
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	3	5.05e-04	40.4	6138	6344	10000	10	80

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands.

This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	-3	1.46e-12	65.4	9041	8733	10000	2	110
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-3	6.48e-08	52.4	9974	9624	10000	2	120
CDD:260011	cd09279, RNase_HI_like, RNAse HI family that includes archaeal, some bacterial as well as plant RNase HI.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two evolutionarily unrelated families, type 1 (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type 2 (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.	-3	0.001	40.0	9974	9630	10000	3	125

CDD:260004	cd09272, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1, Ty1/Copia family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses. The Ty1/Copia family is widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi, and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	-1	4.07e-67	222	4114	3695	10000	1	139

CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	-1	5.05e-04	40.4	6784	6578	10000	10	80

They contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and have been proposed to integrate via double-stranded closed-circle DNA intermediates assisted by an encoded recombinase which is similar to gamma-site-specific integrase.	2	7.81e-10	57.9	7286	7630	10000	1	119
CDD:260007	cd09275, RNase_HI_RT_DIRS1, DIRS1 family of RNase HI in long-term repeat retroelements.  Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. The structural features of DIRS1-group elements are different from typical LTR elements. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.	2	2.51e-08	53.5	7913	8269	10000	2	119
CDD:238822	cd01644, RT_pepA17, RT_pepA17: Reverse transcriptase (RTs) in retrotransposons. This subfamily represents the RT domain of a multifunctional enzyme. C-terminal to the RT domain is a domain homologous to aspartic proteinases (corresponding to Merops family A17) encoded by retrotransposons and retroviruses. RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template and is responsible for the replication of retroelements.	2	5.68e-07	51.7	7148	7579	10000	12	174
CDD:133136	cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	2	2.97e-06	46.5	6206	6478	10000	1	92

Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts.

CDD:307008	pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	2	1.49e-12	65.4	2	301	10000	15	114
