REPRODUCING THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN THE MAIN TEXT AND ITS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

To reproduce such results, one can either run (now) RepeatMasker, HMMER, and RPS-Blast or simply use results previously obtained.

The "Dmel.zip" and "Tair.zip" files have the complete structure in terms of the needed directories for testing the scripts made available here. Just extract the content of each file.

In each (extracted) main directory (for D.melanogaster and for A.thaliana) you will find scripts and other sub-directories (with the annotations and empty and non-empty ones for the (new) results produced now - the sub-diretories for the used programs have results previously obtained).


A) Reproducing the results running the 3 programs:

TOOLS:
The tests were performed using RepeatMasker (RM), HMMER, and RPS-Blast programs; they were run using their default parameter settings.


GENOMES and ANNOTATIONS:
The used genomes and annotations:
- for D. melanogaster: downloaded from FlyBase (flybase.org), version 6.15:
	- ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r6.15_FB2017_02/fasta/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.15.fasta.gz
	- ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r6.15_FB2017_02/fasta/dmel-all-transposon-r6.15.fasta.gz

- for A. thaliana: downloaded from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (arabidopsis.org), version TAIR10:
	- ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/plants/release-48/fasta/arabidopsis_thaliana/dna/
		(files: "Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.CHROMO_NUM.fa.gz")
	- https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/Araport11_genome_release/Araport11_GFF3_genes_transposons.201606.gff.gz

	ABOUT "DNA_version-10" and "TRANSPOSONS_version-11" for A. thaliana:
	the "https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/Araport11_genome_release/README.201606.md" file describes that:
	"TAIR10_sequence_edits.txt - Same file as in TAIR10 release. There were no chromosome sequence edits from TAIR10 to
	Araport11. More details in the file itself.

Here, in this folder, the "Annotation_Dmel.tar.xz" and "Annotation_TAIR.tar.xz" files describe the annotations for D. melanogaster and A. thaliana, respectively, in a format ready to be used in the comparisons with predictions of the used tools.

In the tests, **before running the programs**, the chromosomes were split in subsequences of length of 10,000 nt, with an overlapping region of 1,000 nt (using "splitOverlap.pl" script from "scripts" folder).


REFERENCE SEQUENCES:
The reference sequences of LTR-RT were obtained from Repbase (https://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/), version 18.01, used to build the library for RM and to train the pHMMs (the 3 different types for each superfamily). This version provides the necessary information for the tests: the nucleotide (NT) sequences related to the INTERNAL regions of TEs, the start and end positions of their coding sequences (CDS), and the corresponding TE classification. 
The sequences of any Drosophila and Arabidopsis were excluded from the sets used to build the library for RM and to train the pHMMs to avoid bias, trying to simulate searches for LTR-RT on a newly sequenced genome.

For RM, each reference sequence was labeled with the corresponding superfamily.


ABOUT THE USED pHMMs:
i) the INTERNAL regions of TEs were used to train the pHMMs corresponding to the ways of selecting reference sequences referred to as "conventional way" and "clustering the conventional way" described in the README file, in the main folder of GitHub (please, see there);
ii) the CDS were searched for conserved domains of LTR-RT and the ones presenting at least one region recognized as related to conserved domains of LTR-RT were selected to train the pHMMs - please, see more about this way of selecting reference sequences ("clustering CDS regions") in the README file cited above.

The CD-Hit and MAFFT programs were used to cluster and align the sequences of each formed cluster.

The pHMMs resulting from the trainning process using the reference sequences obtained from Repbase are in the files:
- pHMMs_Dmel.tar.xz: for D. melanogaster;
- pHMMs_Tair_all_references.tar.xz: for A. thaliana, using ALL reference sequences of Repbase;
- pHMMs_Tair_only_plants_references.tar.xz: for A. thaliana, using only reference sequences of PLANTS present in Repbase.


ABOUT RUNNING RPS-Blast:
RPS-Blast uses a database to search for conserved domains of protein in a query sequence. The user can download the original PSSM base available at CDD (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd_help.shtml). However, using it, RPS-Blast may take hours to finish.
An alternative: to use the customized database available here ("database_RPSB.tar.xz" file). This database considers only the following conserved domains of LTR-RT (used in the tests):
- Bel-PAO: DUF1759, Peptidase_A17, DUF1758, RT_pepA17;
- Copia: Retrotran_gag, gag_pre-integrs, RVT_2, RNase_HI_RT_Ty1;
- Gypsy: Retrotrans_gag, gag-asp_proteas, retropepsin_like, RP_Saci_like, RVP_2, RT_LTR, RVT_1, RVT_3, RNase_HI_RT_Ty3, RNase_HI_like.
And also rve ("integrase"), common for Bel-PAO, Copia, and Gypsy.

How to run RPS-Blast:
you can use:
> ./rpstblastn -query INPUT_FASTA_FILE_NAME -db mydb -outfmt "7 sacc stitle qframe evalue bitscore qstart qend qlen sstart send" -out OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
In this command, "mydb" parameter refers to "mydb.pal" file (available inside the "database_RPSB.tar.xz" file) - for the command above, "mydb.pal" must be in the same directory of "rpstblastn" program.


After running the 3 programs, insert their results (the raw data) inside the corresponding sub-directory (for example, inside "Results_HMMER").
WARNING: the names of the files with these raw data must follow the format of the names of the files inside those sub-directories - see there.


B) Reproducing the results using initial predictions previously obtained:
In this option, since the 3 programs would not be run, the initial predictions related to each program are already inside the corresponding sub-directory (e.g., "Results_HMMER").

Observe that:
i) files with "Complete" in their names correspond to results from running HMMER using only the pHMMs related to the way of obtaining reference sequences called "conventional way" (see above);
ii) for A. thaliana, several sub-directories have 2 other sub-directories: "All_references" and "Only_plants"; they have results related to run HMMER and RepeatMasker on the chromosomes using either ALL the reference sequences present in Repbase or the ones related to PLANTS only.


C) Running the needed scripts:
The scripts made available in the "scripts" directory received adaptations to run for each situation described in the manuscript: different organisms and different sets of reference sequences.

Despite the way the raw results from the 3 programs are obtained (running them again or using the ones made available here), the "reproducingDmel.pl" and "reproducingTair.pl" scripts can be run to generate the necessary files - after extracting the complete directory structure from the "Dmel.zip" and "Tair.zip" files, go to a main directory ("Dmel" or "Tair") and run the corresponding script.

After that, the results shown in ALL tables of the Supplementary Material will be in the files of the sub-directories:
Dmel/X_Tables_S1-S2
Dmel/X_Tables_S7-S8
Dmel/X_Tables_S9
Tair/X_Tables_S3-S4
Tair/X_Tables_S5-S6.

I) For Tables S1 and S2 for "Dmel":
- go to the "Dmel/X_Tables_S1-S2" directory;
- the numbers shown in Tables S1 and S2 are at the end of the produced files;
- the names of the files correspond to the intended results and the used filters; for example:
	"Summary_FNs_HMMER_1e-05-RepeatMasker_230.cmp" (with "FNs") file is for the number of false negative and
	"Summary_FPs_HMMER_1e-05-RepeatMasker_230.cmp" (with "FPs") file for the false positive predictions,
	both produced using filters of "1e-05" and "230" for predictions from HMMER and RM, respectively.

For example, for the "No filter" versus "No filter" line (the first line) in Tables S1 and S2: using filter of "100" (meaning "No filter" for HMMER) and "225" (the default value of RM, considered "No filter"), the lines of interest are:
- in the "Summary_FNs_HMMER_100-RepeatMasker_225.cmp" file (look at section):
	General total of FNs for:
		HMMER: 2066
		RepeatMasker: 2172
- in the "Summary_FPs_HMMER_100-RepeatMasker_225.cmp" file (look at section):
	General total of FPs from:
		HMMER: 1216 
		RepeatMasker: 12930
These numbers appear in the corresponding columns of those tables
*************
WARNING: in Table S2, the number (216) showed in the "FP" column for the "pHMMs" (for the "No filter" versus "No filter" line) is not correct; based on the above, this value should be 1,216 (in Table S1, such a value is correct).
*************

For the "Conventional pHMMs" column in Table S1, see the equivalent files (7 files for "FNs" and 7 for "FPs") with the word "Complete" in their names (e.g., "Summary_FNs_HMMER_100-RepeatMasker_500-Complete.cmp" and "Summary_FPs_HMMER_100-RepeatMasker_500-Complete.cmp").
Observe that "RepeatMasker_500" appears in the names of all these 14 files. Although this filter value (500) for RM has been used by the related script, the results for RM DO NOT matter - THE INTERESTING values/numbers in these files are the ones related ONLY to HMMER (for the "Conventional pHMMs").

Below Table S2, there are some comments about the numbers in such a table; one of them is about the TEs that were correctly predicted by both tools: "from the total of TEs correctly predicted by both tools together, between 26% and 22% were predicted ....".
To obtain the numbers showed specifically in this comment, open the "Summary_FNs_HMMER_1e-05-RepeatMasker_400.cmp" (and also "Summary_FNs_HMMER_1e-30-RepeatMasker_500.cmp") file. The last 2 lines of this file (files) show:
"General total of TPs for the 2 tools together: 1984, being 550 TPs EXCLUSIVE of each tool."
"From 1984 TPs together, 520 (26.2%) were predicted only by HMMER and 30 (1.51%) only by RepeatMasker."

The numbers of interest here (that appear in that comment) are: "1984"; "520 (26.2%)"; and "30 (1.51%)".

The "1,434" value that also appears in that comment ("1,434 are common correct predictions") was obtained from: 1,984("General total of TPs") minus 550("TPs EXCLUSIVE of each tool").

An observation about the number "550(TPs EXCLUSIVE of each tool)": in the mentioned file, we find:
	General total of **FNs** EXCLUSIVE of:
		HMMER: 30
		RepeatMasker: 520
the **FNs** EXCLUSIVE for a tool are the **TPs** (correct predictions) EXCLUSIVE for the other tool.


II) For Tables S3 and S4 and also for Tables S5 and S6 for "Tair": equivalent analyses.


III) For Tables S7 and S8 for "Dmel":
- go to the "Dmel/X_Tables_S7-S8" directory;
- the files there present the total of combined predictions, and percentages of correct ones, produced by a set of One, Two, or Three tools (in the tests, HMMER, RM, and RPS-Blast programs);
- the numbers shown in those tables (particularly, in Table S8) are at the end of those files;
- the names of the files correspond to the used filter for predictions from HMMER, RM, and RPS-Blast, in this sequence - the filter for HMMER and RPS-Blast are always the same. For example:
- "Summary_comparedGroups-100-225-100.txt" file: using "100" (meaning "No filter") for HMMER/RPS-Blast and "225" (the default value, considered "No filter") for RM;
- "Summary_comparedGroups-1e-05-400-1e-05.txt" file: filter of "1e-05" for HMMER/RPS-Blast and "400" for RM.

Each line in those files (in the "SUMMARY" section) is self-explanatory.
Observe that, in lines like this: 
"- TOTAL: 2399 => Bel: 236; Copia: 167; Gypsy: 1557; multiSPfam: 439; inconclusive: 0;"
values like "439" (multiSPfam - combined predicitons that received more than one classification) and "0" (inconclusive) produce the sum shown in the "others" column of Table S8.


IV) For Table S9 for "Dmel":
- go to the "Dmel/X_Tables_S9" directory;
- the files there described about the total of combined predictions described (initially) as false positive ones (based on the Dmel annotation) and the ones that have at least one of the used metrics considered as a good one (i.e., low E-value and/or high SW score);
- the name of each file describes the number of tools considered to produce the combined predictions present in that file.

For example, for the "comparedGroupsGoodMetrics-THREE.txt" file (results from combining candidates produced by all the THREE tools), for the first block of information ("Values used as "good" metrics -- HMMER: 1e-10 - RepeatMasker: 400 - RPS-Blast: 1e-10"),
the line:
"TOTAL --- Preds: 1817 -->> FPs: 520 -->> FPs with good metrics: 520 (100%)"
means that, for the used "good metrics", from a total of 1,817 combined predictions, 520 (28.6%) were initially defined as FP ones but 520 (100%) present at least a metrics considered as a good one.
